    - "They don\u2019t pay us enough for this."
    - Maybe we should unionize.
  - lines:
    - How are the wife and kids?
    - Well, you know.
    - And the miss?
    - "She\u2019s great!"
  - lines:
    - Some weather.
    - Yup.
    - Got a cig?
    - Sure.
    - Got a light?
    - Why do I get stuck with you, every time.
  - lines:
    - "There\u2019s just too many vowels."
    - "It\u2019s annoying isn\u2019t it?"
    - Such a clunky language.
    - "Boss said we\u2019ve got to learn it. "
  - lines:
    - We playing cards tonight?
    - Not with the deck you made us use last night.
    - "Saying I\u2019m cheating?"
    - "I\u2019m saying I don\u2019t like your deck."
  - lines:
    - You hear that?
    - Probably those racoons again.
  - lines:
    - Captain keeps yelling at me.
    - For what?
    - "Says prisoners keep escaping\u2026?"
    - Escaping, here?
  - lines:
    - "Doesn\u2019t tonight seem a little eerie?"
    - "Yeah, like we\u2019ve been here before?"
  - lines:
    - OK. So Captain yelled at me AGAIN.
    - "What, you\u2019re kidding?"
    - Yeah, prisoners are escaping again, it's only happening on our shift.
  - lines:
    - Alright, I went around the entire perimeter on both the interior and exterior,
      climbed on top of the buildings one by one and then entered them. I checked
      every room and under every bed and in every closet I could find. Also, you
      left the coffee pot on.
    - "Oh, thanks\u2026 I hope this works\u2026"
  - lines:
    - "So I talked to the captain, he said a memo went out\u2026"
    - A memo?
    - "That\u2019s what I said\u2026"
    - Uh-oh
    - "Yeah, he flipped. I swear, where are these guys escaping from? We\u2019re
      just standing here talking. Nothing ever happens and then I\u2019m getting
      balked at for not getting a memo."
    - "I don\u2019t know, this is starting to get strange. Like we both didn\u2019t
      get the memo? Is that intentional? "
  - lines:
    - 'Remember how you said the other night felt eerily similar? '
    - "Stop mate, you\u2019re freaking me out!"
  - lines:
    - "So I\u2019ve been thinking, what if, what if \u2026. the prisoners are digging
      their way out?"
    - "Stop. That\u2019s impossible."
    - No, no, wait. Think about it. Ground is really soft, we got a couple pick axes
      around.
    - This is a waste of our time.
    - You NEVER go with my ideas.
    - "That\u2019s not true."
    - Is so.
    - "What do you want me to do? Walk around with a metal detector, see if they\u2019re
      crawling beneath our feet?"
    - "If that\u2019s what it takes-- yes!"
    - Why am I always stuck with you?!
  - lines:
    - Hey.
    - Hey.
    - I brought you a sandwich.
    - Thanks, man.
    - "Hey, I\u2019m real sorry about last night."
    - "No, I get it. It\u2019s the stress\u2026 I\u2019m sorry too. Maybe we should
      try the metal detector thing?"
    - "I mean, nah\u2026 what are the chances they are just digging anyway. There
      has to be another answer."
    - Going airborne?
    - "Now we\u2019re onto something. "
  - lines:
    - The same night, it feels like the same night every night.
    - I never did like the night shifts. Have I ever told you I was afraid of the
      dark as a kid?
