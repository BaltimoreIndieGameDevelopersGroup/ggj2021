  introText: The year is 1952. After a series of alien abductions the U.S. government
    attempts to make First Contact. These attempts at communication are a disastrous
    failure and the extraterrestrials see fit to enslave and neutralize the backwater
    planet known as Earth. A resistance of Earthlings from around the globe form
    an underground fighting force. As one of the top operatives of this cell you
    have been intentionally captured. Your mission is to obtain whatever scraps of
    alien technology you can and escape the camp. Good luck agent!
