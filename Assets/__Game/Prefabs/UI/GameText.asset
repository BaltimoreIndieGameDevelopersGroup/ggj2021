  introText: The year is 1952. After a series of alien abductions the U.S. government
    attempts to make First Contact. These attempts at communication are a disastrous
    failure and the extraterrestrials see fit to enslave and neutralize the backwater
    planet known as Earth. A resistance of Earthlings from around the globe form
    an underground fighting force. As one of the top operatives of this cell you
    have been intentionally captured. Your mission is to obtain whatever scraps of
    alien technology you can and escape the camp. Good luck agent!
  victoryText:
  - The operative jumps out of his hole and springs towards the tree line. The Little
    Green Men are none the wiser as vital pieces of information trickle from this
    unlikely source. With the information you gathered the resistance bolstered her
    numbers tenfold! Earthings start to flock in from all over, Radio transmissions
    start going out and whispers of hope return. Like Prometheus you have brought
    humanity the spark that it needs.
  - "After long trials and many months human scientists are able to reverse engineer
    alien technologies. This turns our glimmer of hope into a sharpened point! Those
    aliens won\u2019t know what hit them! Engineers create weapons, armour and small
    crafts to combat the invaders. Once a rebel force cowering and hidden in the
    shadows, humanity is now the predator who waits at the edge of darkness. Stalking
    and waiting for the perfect moment to strike."
  - 'After two long years humanity mounts a full out assault in order to recapture
    and defend Rapid City, South Dakota. The aliens, unaware of the technological
    advancements, are routed from the area with little effort. With the new technology
    in place this city and its surrounding areas become a safe haven. The Little
    Green Men are forced out of the Dakotas and wait ominously in the horizon to
    capture any humans trying to make their way to the sanctuary of Rapid City. '
  - 'The conflicts and small skirmishes give way to total war. The aliens no longer
    seek to enslave and use the people of earth instead they want to obliterate humanity
    and erase Earth from the galaxy. Humanity escalates their ferocity in turn. Operatives
    turned warriors and now warriors turned zealot. Earthlings push on with a bloodlust
    never before seen by The Little Green Men. As if Earthlings feet were rooted
    into the planet they defended and clutched onto her like a child would a mother.  '
  - "VE Day is here! Victory on Earth is the headlines all around the world-- what\u2019s
    left of it anyway. The alien invaders take to their mothership and leave just
    as fast as they had arrived. Earthlings start to pick up the pieces and construct
    a new world far more advanced than when this conflict began. There are parades
    in the streets and music fills the air. You can hear Mother Earth herself sigh
    a great sigh of relief. Perhaps these humans were good to keep around after all?"
